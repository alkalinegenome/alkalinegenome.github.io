			<p>SHINE is for Bell High School's anti-bullying club to be printed on club t-shirts. The project had to inspire and communicate the idea of anti-bullying. In hopes to avoid literally saying anti-bullying, a lighthouse was utilized as a symbolic gesture for individuals withstand on both sunny and stormy days and to be a beacon for others to follow.</p>

			<p>Darren Aronofsky's <em>The Fountain</em> is both a visually and acoustically rich movie. With a deeply moving and thematic soundtrack, the design reflects—at times—the quiet somber and sadness—and at others—a cathartic and pent up release. The album cover was also based on both the soundtrack's and movie's theme regarding the cyclical nature of things. The illustration features the tree within the dyson sphere, and the nebulous outer shells of the dying star—from which new life arises from their deaths.</p>

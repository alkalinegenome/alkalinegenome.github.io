			<p>Forth is an exploration of typography in relation to line, form, light and shadow. It is a map lacking in directions, orientation or landmarks. It urges onlookers to explore and become lost in the ridges and folds of the world. As with any journey, there is always more to discover. <em>Forth</em> is an ongoing experiment and new pages will be updated from time to time. </p>

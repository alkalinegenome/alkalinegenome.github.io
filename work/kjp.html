			<p>KJP Select Hardwoods is a local family-owned store with a large selection of wood for many uses and professions. Because KJP has such a craftsmen oriented market (cabinet makers, woodworkers, etc), the logo follows a more traditional vintage look. The logo emulates the respect, gravitas, and the dedication that craftsmen impart unto their works.</p>

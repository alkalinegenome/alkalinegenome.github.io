{% include pieces.html title="Forth" desc="A Typographic Adventure" about="Forth is an exploration of typography in relation to line, form, light and shadow. It is a map lacking in directions, orientation or landmarks. It urges onlookers to explore and become lost in the ridges and folds of the world. As with any exploration, there is always more to discover—with that in mind, more pieces continue to be added over time.

{% include pieces.html title="SHINE" desc="A Statement Against Bullying" about="SHINE is for the local high school's anti-bullying club. To be printed on club t-shirts, this piece expanded beyond its original intent to appear in print flyers, brochures, posters, digital correspondence, on the web and fabric patches. The project had to inspire and communicate the idea of anti-bullying. In hopes to avoid the literally saying anti-bullying, a lighthouse was utilized as the symbol—to withstand on both sunny and stormy days and to be a beacon for others to follow." thumb1="/thumbs/shine/1thumb.jpg" img1="/images/shine/1.jpg" alt1="" thumb2="/thumbs/shine/2thumb.jpg" img2="/images/shine/2.jpg" alt2="" thumb3="/thumbs/shine/3thumb.jpg" img3="/images/shine/3.jpg" alt3="" thumb4="" img5="" alt5="" thumb6="" img6="" alt6="" thumb7="" img7="" alt7="" thumb8="" img8="" alt8="" %}

{% include pieces.html title="KJP" desc="A (Re)Branding Experiment" about="I took a company that had no to minimal branding and gave it an identity. KJP was a fun and particularly challenging project as unlike their competition their sole specialty is their extensive and gorgeous selection of wood.

{% include pieces.html title="Caribou Coffee Package" desc="Bold Taste with Matching Packaging" about="The Caribou Coffee brand is down to earth with a quirky attitude to boot. To continue this attitude, this project uses a careful selection of quality materials, detailed touches, and celebrates the ideal of setting itself apart. In-depth and careful research revealed a startling pattern to coffee packaging trends. In response, the package employs bold eye-catching colors particular to the flavor to adorn the container, a slanted top-opening creates a novel encounter for the user, a glass container wrapped in a dense burlap (to prevent light entering which preserves the beans) gives the individual a tactile experience. The interior of the box is decorated with all the icons in the Caribou flavor line. This packaging helps promote Caribou's philosophy of quality above all else." thumb1="" img1="" alt1="" thumb2="" img2="" alt2="" thumb3="" img3="" alt3="" thumb4="" img5="" alt5="" thumb6="" img6="" alt6="" thumb7="" img7="" alt7="" thumb8="" img8="" alt8="" %}

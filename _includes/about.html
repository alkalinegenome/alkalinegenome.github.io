	<p class="planet w300 v-align bottom-none about-text grey">Hey there! My name is Gabriel. I'm a creative who loves paper, packaging, branding, handmade things, and illustration. Every design tells a story, and I utilize emotive and tactile experiences to make that story worth telling.</p>
	<p class="cell w300 v-align bottom-none grey">Other hobbies I enjoy are: <em>astrophotography/stargazing, infrared landscape photography, bookbinding, getting sufficiently lost on the Trans Canada Pathway, and exploring new places.</em></p>
